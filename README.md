  ## Description
  In this project I was instructed to make a digital note taker for a small business. The note taker uses a the express server to store, retrieve, and delete data from the note taker. The user can view their list of previous notes, create new notes, and delete notes. This assignment helped me to better understand backend api and how it relates to front end development.
